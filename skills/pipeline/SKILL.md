# Pipeline

Work with the forge pipeline for a commit. The entry point for forge-pipeline
operations; today it reports status and watches. Two needs, one skill:

- **Status (default)** — *"what's the pipeline doing?"* / *"get the latest
  pipeline."* A one-shot read: resolve the pipeline for the commit and report
  its state now.
- **Watch** — *"tell me when it's done"* / *"notify me when CI passes."* Poll
  in the background until the pipeline reaches a terminal state, then report.

GitHub calls a pipeline a *workflow run* and GitLab calls it a *pipeline*; this
skill uses **pipeline** for both, and `glab api` / `gh run` for the forge calls.

**Don't narrate your work.** Every step below is an operating instruction, not a
script to read aloud. Don't announce the repo resolution, the forge detection,
or the background launch. Speak only when the user must act or decide: the
resolved repo in one line if it's ambiguous, and the pipeline verdict.

## Task tracking when orchestrated

At the very start, call `TaskList`. If any task is already `in_progress`, this
skill is running inside an orchestrator (e.g. a release workflow) — run silently
and do **not** create your own tasks; the orchestrator's list is the source of
truth. If nothing is `in_progress`, this is a single-step check — skip
task-tracking.

## Target repo

Resolve which repo this operates on — the working directory isn't a reliable
proxy. Re-resolve on every invocation.

- **With an argument** (`/anchor:pipeline <name>`): case-insensitive
  substring-match `<name>` against the basename of every git repo the session
  has touched. One match → use it (confirm in one line). Zero or multiple → list
  the candidates and ask.
- **No argument**: run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` from the working
  directory. If the session touched more than one repo, or edits landed outside
  it, state the resolved path and ask which to target.

Run the helper from the resolved repo (`cd` there, or it reads the wrong
`origin`).

## Pick the mode

Read the request:

- **Watch** when the ask is to wait or be notified — *"watch the pipeline,"*
  *"tell me when it's done,"* *"notify me when CI passes,"* *"wait for the
  build."* Also the natural mode right after a push.
- **One-shot** otherwise — *"pipeline status,"* *"get the latest pipeline,"*
  *"is the build green,"* *"did it pass?"* — and whenever you just need the
  state once.

When watching, it's worth a quick precondition check: a pipeline only exists
once the commit is on the remote. `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/look-ahead.sh"`
prints the unpushed-commit count — if it's `>= 1`, the pushed remote tip isn't
HEAD, so tell the user and ask whether to push first or watch the current tip.
A one-shot read needs no such check — it just reports `none` if there's no
pipeline for the commit.

## Run the helper

The helper detects the forge from the `origin` remote (`gh`/GitHub or
`glab`/GitLab), resolves the pipeline for the current branch at HEAD's commit,
and prints the verdict on stdout. The forge plumbing — including the GitLab
path's `glab api projects/:fullpath/...` calls — lives in the script; the forge
cookbook's **CI / pipelines** section documents the same invocations.

**One-shot (default)** — runs and returns immediately, so call it in the
foreground and read the result:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pipeline-status.sh"
```

**Watch** — add `--watch`. It blocks while it polls, so launch it as a
**background call** (`run_in_background: true`); a foreground call would hold the
turn open until the Bash timeout. When it completes, read its stdout with the
**BashOutput tool** (not `tail` / `$(...)`, which trip the command-substitution
gate):

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pipeline-status.sh" --watch
```

To target a branch or commit other than the current HEAD (e.g. an orchestrator
that pushed `main` directly), pass `--branch <b>` and/or `--sha <sha>`. In watch
mode, poll cadence and the watch ceiling default to 15s / 30min and can be tuned
with `--interval <s>` / `--timeout <s>`.

The output is `KEY=value` lines:

- `PIPELINE_STATE` — `success` · `failed` · `canceled` · `skipped` · `manual` ·
  `running` · `pending` · `none` (no pipeline for this commit) · `absent`
  (origin isn't a recognized forge). In watch mode, `PIPELINE_TIMEOUT=1` marks
  the last non-terminal state when the ceiling was hit.
- `PIPELINE_URL` — the pipeline's web page (link it).
- `PIPELINE_FAILED_JOBS` — present only when `PIPELINE_STATE=failed`: a JSON
  array of `{name, url}` (GitHub) or `{name, stage, url}` (GitLab).

## Report

Map `PIPELINE_STATE` to exactly this and nothing more:

- **`success`** → `✓ Pipeline passed` with the `PIPELINE_URL`.
- **`running` / `pending`** *(one-shot only — watch mode never returns here)* →
  report that it's still in flight, with the `PIPELINE_URL`, and offer to watch.
- **`failed`** → `✗ Pipeline failed`, then list each job from
  `PIPELINE_FAILED_JOBS` (name, linked to its `url`), and the pipeline
  `PIPELINE_URL`. Offer to look at a failed job's log if the user wants to dig
  in — don't fetch logs unprompted.
- **`canceled` / `skipped` / `manual`** → report the terminal state plainly with
  the `PIPELINE_URL`. `manual` means the pipeline is blocked awaiting a manual
  action — say so; it won't progress on its own.
- **`none`** → no pipeline for this commit. Common causes: path/branch filters
  excluded it, the commit isn't pushed, or the repo has no CI for this ref.
  State that; don't treat it as a failure.
- **`absent`** → the `origin` remote isn't GitHub or GitLab, so there's no
  pipeline to report. Say so.
- **`PIPELINE_TIMEOUT=1`** → the watch ceiling elapsed before a terminal state;
  report the last state and offer to keep watching (re-launch with a longer
  `--timeout`).

In watch mode the report *is* the notification — the harness surfaces it when
the background watch completes, so there's nothing to schedule or poll.
